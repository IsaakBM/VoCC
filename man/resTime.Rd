\title{Climatic residence time of a polygon}
\usage{
resTime(pg, vel, areapg = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{pg}{\code{SpatialPolygon} or a \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} containing the polygons for which
the residence time is to be calculated. The polygons must be on the same coordinate system as vel.}

\item{vel}{\code{raster} with local climate velocity (km/year) for the period of interest.}

\item{areapg}{\code{vector} with the area (in km2) of the polygons. Use NA (default) to calculate internally if field not avilable.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} containing for each polygon its ID, mean velocity (km/yr),
diameter of the equivalent circle (km), and residence time (years) as the ratio D/vel.
}
\description{
Function to calculate vocc residence time of a polygon after Loaire et al. (2009)
}
\examples{

# Load example Exclusive Economic Zone polygons

data(EEZs)
# Calculating area internally
a1 <- resTime(EEZs, vel, areapg = NA)
a1
# Using the area field from the polygon data table
a2 <- resTime(EEZs, vel, areapg = EEZs$Area_km2)
a2
