\title{Climate velocity trajectory classification}
\usage{
trajClas(traj, vel, ang, mn, trajSt, tyr, nmL, smL , Nend, Nst, NFT)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj}{\code{data.frame} as retuned by voccTraj containing the coordinates
and identification number for each trajectory.}

\item{vel}{\code{raster} with the magnitude of gradient-based climate velocity.}

\item{ang}{\code{raster} with velocity angles.}

\item{mn}{\code{raster} with mean climatic values for the study period.}

\item{trajSt}{\code{integer} number of trajectories starting from each cell or spatial unit.}

\item{tyr}{\code{integer} number of years comprising the projected period.}

\item{nmL}{\code{numeric} upper threshold (distance units as per vel object) up to which
a trajectory is considered to have traveled a negligible distance over the study period (non-moving).}

\item{smL}{\code{numeric} upper threshold up to which a trajectory is considered to have traveled a small
distance over the study period (slow-moving).}

\item{Nend}{\code{numeric} the percentage of trajectories ending to be used as threshold in the classification.}

\item{Nst}{\code{numeric} the percentage of trajectories starting to be used as threshold in the classification.}

\item{NFT}{\code{numeric} the percentage of trajectories flowing through to be used as threshold in the classification.}

\value{
A \code{raster.stack} containing the trajectory classification ("TrajClas"),
as well as those based on trajectory length ("ClassL"; 1 non-moving, 2 slow-moving, 3 fast-moving cells),
boundrary ("BounS") and internal sinks ("IntS"), and the proportion of trajectories ending("PropEnd"),
flowing through ("PropFT") and starting ("PropSt"). The trajectory classes ("TrajClas") are (1) non-moving,
(2) slow-moving, (3) internal sinks, (4) boundary sinks, (5) sources, (6) relative sinks, (7) corridors,
(8) divergence and (9) convergence.

\description{
Function for the spatial classification of cells based on VoCC trajectories after Burrows et al. (2014). The function performs
a hierarchical sequential classification based on length of trajectories, geographical features, and the relative abundance of
trajectories ending in, starting from and flowing through each cell. Essentially, cells are first classified as non-moving,
slow-moving and fast-moving relative to the distance a trajectory will cover over the projection period based on local climate velocities.
Two types of climate sinks are then identified among the fast-moving cells: (i) boundary (e.g., coastal) cells disconnected from cooler (warmer)
neighbouring cells under a locally warming (cooling) climate, and (ii) locations with endorheic spatial gradients where the velocity angles of
neighbouring cells converge towards their central point of intersection. Finally, the remaining cells are classified by reference to the total
number of trajectories per cell based on the proportions of the number of trajectories starting from (Nst), ending in (Nend), and flowing
through (NFT) a cell over the period. Based on these proportions, cells are classified into five classes: (1) climate sources, when no
trajectories end in a cell (Nend = 0); (2) relative climate sinks, when the relative number of trajectories ending in a cell is high and the
proportion of starting trajectories is low; (3) corridors as cells with a high proportion of trajectories passing through; and (4) divergence
and (5) convergence cells identified from the remaining cells as those where fewer/more trajectories ended than started in that
cell, respectively.
